    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Warspoon is my hobby desk, posted online.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paint miniatures, build terrain, print bases, and come up with narrative campaigns. Sometimes I do all of those well. Sometimes I strip a whole army and start over because the purple wasn't working. Either way, it ends up here.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Site Is</h2>
    <p>
      A place to share what I'm building and how I'm building it. Paint recipes with exact colors so you can actually replicate them. Showcase photos of finished work. Free STL files for bases and terrain. Honest write-ups about what worked, what didn't, and what I'd do differently next time.
    </p>
    <p>
      No tutorials, I'm not what you'd call 'qualified'. No monetization, mo money mo problems. No schedule, this is for funsies.
    </p>

    <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
    <p>Right now the desk has a few things going:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Death Guard</strong> — A 30K-to-40K corruption army in bone armor with toxic wasteland bases. The scheme that replaced the purple.</li>
      <li><strong>508th Siege Regiment</strong> — Death Korps of Krieg with custom winter trench terrain and an artillery crew where someone keeps falling asleep on the job.</li>
      <li><strong>Adepta Sororitas</strong> — A Sisters force that started with no name and no colors. They're earning both through Crusade gameplay.</li>
      <li><strong>Mandrake Kill Team</strong> — Getting the full comic book treatment. Bold black lines, exaggerated highlights, zero blending.</li>
      <li><strong>3D Printed Bases & Terrain</strong> — Designed in Blender, printed on a Bambu A1 Mini, shared free on MakerWorld.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Name</h2>
    <p>
      War + Spoon. It's a hobby about tiny plastic soldiers fighting in grim darkness, and I thought it should have a name that doesn't take itself too seriously. The spoon has a bandana. It's been through some things.
