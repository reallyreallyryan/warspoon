## The Regiment

This Death Korps of Krieg force was painted over six months as a slow-burn project. The goal was a muted, desaturated palette that captures the bleak, WWI-inspired aesthetic of the Korps without going full black-and-white.

## Paint Scheme

### Greatcoats
- **Base**: Zandri Dust
- **Wash**: Seraphim Sepia, followed by selective Agrax Earthshade in deep folds
- **Highlight**: Ushabti Bone
- **Final highlight**: Screaming Skull on raised edges

### Armor and Helmets
- **Base**: Castellan Green
- **Wash**: Athonian Camoshade
- **Highlight**: Loren Forest, then Straken Green on sharp edges
- **Chipping**: Rhinox Hide applied with a torn sponge

### Weapons
- **Metal**: Leadbelcher base, Nuln Oil wash, Ironbreaker edge highlights
- **Wood**: Rhinox Hide, Agrax wash, Baneblade Brown drybrush

## Basing

The trench warfare bases use:
- Stirland Mud texture paint for muddy ground
- Thin strips of balsa wood for duckboards
- Coils of thin wire for barbed wire
- AK Interactive puddle effects in the low points

Each base tells a small story of life in the trenches — a dropped helmet here, a spent shell casing there.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Batch painting is essential** — with 80+ infantry, you need a system
2. **Weathering powders save time** — a single application adds realism to every model at once
3. **Don't overdo the highlights** — the muted look is the whole point
