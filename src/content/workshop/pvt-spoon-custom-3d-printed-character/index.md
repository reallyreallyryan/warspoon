## The Idea

Sometimes the best hobby projects start as a dumb joke that refuses to stay a joke.

Pvt. Spoon began as exactly that — a throwaway bit during a late-night hobby session. What if I designed and printed my own character from scratch? Not a space marine. Not an ork. A spoon. A sentient, angry spoon on a 40mm base with googly eyes and absolutely no way to interact with the world around him.

And then I actually made it.

## Designing v1 in Blender

I'm not a 3D modeling expert. I've been brute-forcing my way through [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for a few weeks now, mostly making [Christmas-themed bases](/workshop/christmas-bases/) for a Space Dwarf kill team. My whole approach to Blender is less "skilled digital sculptor" and more "smash shapes together until something works." Turns out that's a completely valid method.

Here's how Pvt. Spoon v1 came together:

**The bowl** — I started with a torus and sculpted it into a rough spoon bowl shape. Then I selected some of the open faces on the inside and filled them in to close up the geometry. It's not elegant, but it reads as "spoon" and that's all it needs to do.

**The back** — I added a sphere, cut it in half, and attached it to the back of the bowl. Some sculpting to blend the two shapes together and make them look like a single piece rather than two primitives jammed together.

**The handle** — A cube, stretched and sculpted into a handle shape. Again, nothing fancy. The spoon handle is basically the character's body/spine, running down from the bowl to the base.

**The face** — Two spheres for eyes and an oval-shaped sphere for a mouth. Stuck them on the bowl. Suddenly this thing had personality.

That's it. No armature, no fancy modifiers, no retopology. Just primitives, sculpting, and vibes. The whole model sits on a 40mm base, which puts Pvt. Spoon in the Terminator/Ogre size class — chunky enough to print with real detail on FDM and imposing enough on the table to justify a datasheet.

## The First Print

I sent it to the Bambu A1 Mini expecting disaster and got... a spoon. With a face. Standing on a base. It printed clean enough to prime and paint, which is honestly all a v1 needs to be.

He has no arms. No legs. No weapons. He is a spoon. He stands there. He judges you.

This is the version that hits the table first. And his stats reflect that.

## The Datasheets

Pvt. Spoon ships with rules for both full 40K and Kill Team. He's designed to slot into any army as a homebrew addition — faction doesn't matter, because war is war and a spoon is a spoon.

Fair warning: he's terrible. That's the point. But he has one trick.

### Warhammer 40K — 10th Edition Datasheet

**PVT. SPOON** — *Unique Character, Infantry* — **0 pts**

| M | T | SV | W | LD | OC |
|---|---|-----|---|-----|-----|
| 2" | 2 | 6+ | 1 | 8+ | 0 |

**Weapons:** None. He's a spoon.

**Abilities:**

**Stir the Pot (Aura, 6"):** Once per battle, at the start of any Fight phase, select one enemy unit within 6" of Pvt. Spoon. That unit must take a Battle-shock test. This ability can be used even if Pvt. Spoon is within Engagement Range of an enemy unit (though the Emperor alone knows how he got there).

**Cutlery Courage:** Pvt. Spoon can be included in any army regardless of faction. He does not take up a detachment slot. He does not benefit from any faction abilities, detachment abilities, or enhancements. He is a spoon.

**Invulnerable Save:** None.

**Keywords:** Infantry, Character, Unique, Spoon

**Faction Keywords:** None (Any)

**Designer's Note:** *Pvt. Spoon cannot move, shoot, or fight in any meaningful way. His 2" move represents him rocking gently on his base. He is there. That's his whole thing.*

### Kill Team Datasheet

**PVT. SPOON** — *Supplementary Operative*

| APL | M | SV | W |
|-----|---|-----|---|
| 1 | ⬡ | 6+ | 5 |

**Weapons:** None.

**Actions:**

**Stir the Pot (1 AP):** *Interrupt action.* This operative can be activated during an enemy operative's activation, after that operative completes any action. This activation interrupts the normal activation sequence. Pvt. Spoon activates, may perform this action, and then the interrupted operative's activation resumes.

Pvt. Spoon does nothing. His activation ends. Play continues.

The interrupted player may feel annoyed. This is working as intended.

**Unique Rules:**

**Immobile:** Pvt. Spoon cannot perform Move, Dash, Charge, Fall Back, or Traverse actions. He has no legs.

**Unarmed:** Pvt. Spoon cannot perform Shoot or Fight actions. He has no arms.

**Pick Me Up:** A friendly operative within ⬡ of Pvt. Spoon can perform a free Pick Up action during their activation to carry Pvt. Spoon. While carried, Pvt. Spoon moves with that operative and cannot be targeted separately. The carrying operative can set him down at any point during a move. If the carrying operative is incapacitated, place Pvt. Spoon where they fell.

**Cutlery Courage:** Pvt. Spoon can be added to any Kill Team roster regardless of faction, as a supplementary operative that does not count toward your operative limit.

**Designer's Note:** *Yes, his entire purpose is to interrupt your opponent's activation to do absolutely nothing. No, he cannot be activated normally to perform mission actions. Yes, a friendly operative can carry him around like a beloved pet. Yes, this is a real datasheet. Play nice.*

## The Road Ahead

Here's where it gets interesting. Pvt. Spoon isn't a one-off joke — he's a project. The plan is to evolve him over time, both as a model and as a set of rules.

**v2** will add arms. That's a new Blender skill for me (probably extrude-based limb modeling) and it opens up the datasheet. Suddenly Stir the Pot might actually do something when he interrupts. Maybe he can carry an objective. Maybe he gets a weapon — a fork? A smaller spoon?

**v3** gets legs. Now he can move. Now that interrupt ability is actually scary, because he can reposition.

Each version is a new modeling challenge, a new print, and a new datasheet revision. The character grows as my skills grow. And at some point, Pvt. Spoon might actually be... good?

Probably not. But he'll be there. On every table. Stirring the pot.
