Most miniature painting advice points you toward smooth blends, thin layers, and invisible transitions. This is the opposite of that — bold black lines, punchy highlights, flat reads from across the table. Comic book style.

It's not better or worse than traditional painting. It's just a completely different energy. A blended model looks like a tiny real person. A comic book model looks like it stepped out of a panel. Both are cool. This one's more fun.

## What Makes It Comic Book

Two things do most of the work:

**Bold black edge lining.** Every edge where two surfaces meet gets a deliberate black line. Armor panels, cloth folds, weapon edges, anywhere there's a transition. In traditional painting you shade recesses and let the edges catch natural highlights. Here you're drawing the outline like an inker would. It flattens the model in the best way — it reads like a drawing, not a sculpture.

**Exaggerated highlights.** Where traditional painting builds up subtle gradients, comic book style jumps straight to the bright spots. You're not blending from dark blue to medium blue to light blue across a surface. You're putting the bright highlight exactly where light would hit hardest and letting the contrast do the talking. It looks wrong up close and perfect at arm's length.

That's basically it. Black lines define the shapes. Hard highlights sell the lighting. Everything else is just picking colors and being decisive about where they go.

## The Models

### Fafnir Rann — Imperial Fists, 30K

A Horus Heresy character done in full comic book treatment. The yellow Imperial Fists armor is a great fit for this style — big flat panels that let the black lining really pop. The shield especially is where the style shines, all those straight edges with clean black lines between them.

Yellow is also notoriously annoying to paint traditionally (thin coats, multiple layers, streaking). In comic book style you just commit to the color and let the bold lining do the definition work. Way less painful.

The base deserves a mention too — blue with yellow lightning bolts painted right on, keeping the whole thing in that comic book flat-color energy. No texture paste, no flock, just bold shapes and color.

### Custom Chapter — Green and Orange

This one's not a real chapter — just colors I thought would look good together. That's the beauty of comic book style on space marines: you're already working with bold flat panels and strong silhouettes, so any color scheme that has good contrast will work.

The green-grey armor with orange trim gives you warm-cool contrast without being too saturated. The black lining between the armor panels and around the shoulder pads is what really makes the orange trim pop. The cracked earth base keeps the comic styling going — those dark lines radiating out look almost like impact cracks drawn in ink.

### Deathwatch Marine

Silver and black with a red bolter casing. The Deathwatch scheme is already high-contrast, so the comic book treatment amplifies what's already there. The silver armor gets hard white edge highlights that read as reflective glints, and the black lining between silver panels gives every piece of the armor a defined shape.

The red bolter is a nice focal point against all that silver-black. And the base — bright green comic book grass with bold outlines — is probably the most overtly "comic panel" element on any of these models. It doesn't look like real grass. It looks like someone drew grass. That's the point.

### Blood Angels Marine

Red armor is another scheme that benefits from this approach. The comic book highlights on red read as dramatic lighting — like a panel where the Blood Angel is stepping into the light, bright flashes off the helmet and shoulder pads. The black lining between red panels gives the armor definition without needing to shade with darker reds or washes.

### Adeptus Mechanicus Chibi — Praying to an Air Fryer

Yes, it's exactly what it sounds like. A chibi Adeptus Mechanicus tech-priest on their knees in devotion before an air fryer on a Grecian pedestal. The Omnissiah works in mysterious and delicious ways.

Chibi models are already halfway to comic book style with their exaggerated proportions, so the bold lining and hard highlights feel completely natural here. The red robes with white edge highlights, the glowing green lenses, the grey stone base with black line work in the cracks — everything reads immediately. The air fryer itself is the best part — it's sitting on that pedestal like a sacred relic, and the comic book styling makes the whole scene feel like a single illustrated panel.

This one's pure fun. No lore justification needed.

## Why Try It

It's fast, it's forgiving, and it turns heads. People notice comic book minis on the table because they look different from everything around them. There's no "is that highlight smooth enough" anxiety — the whole point is hard edges and confident marks.

It works on pretty much any model too. From Horus Heresy characters to chibi joke pieces to standard infantry — if it has edges, it'll take black lining. The style is the unifying thread across models that have nothing else in common. An Imperial Fist and a tech-priest praying to a kitchen appliance shouldn't sit next to each other, but in comic book style they look like they're from the same artist's portfolio.

If you've been painting for a while and everything's starting to feel like the same process on different models, try this on something small. Pick a model you're not precious about, grab a fine-tip brush for the lining, and just go for it. Worst case you strip it. Best case you find a style that makes painting fun in a way it hasn't been for a minute.
