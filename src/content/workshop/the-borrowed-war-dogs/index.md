The Death Guard hit the Krieg trench line and bounced. Hard. A small patrol probing for weak points in the 508th Siege Regiment's defenses, and the Krieg didn't just hold — they made the Death Guard pay for the attempt.

So the warband regrouped and made a call. Not for reinforcements from the Plague Fleet. Not for daemonic intervention. They hired contractors.

Meet The Borrowed.

## Who Are The Borrowed

The Borrowed are [Dreadblades](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/War_Dog) — War Dogs that have broken free from any Knight House allegiance and work as mercenary muscle. Think of them as a chaos-flavored PMC. You've got a problem you can't solve with infantry? You hire The Borrowed. They show up, they break things, they collect whatever passes for payment in the warp, and they move on to the next job.

The name fits how they operate. They're never yours. You don't own them, you don't command them, you don't trust them. You borrow them for as long as the arrangement holds, and you hope they don't decide you're more interesting as a target than a client.

For this campaign, they were brought in after the Death Guard's failed probe to do what plague marines couldn't — crack an entrenched Krieg position with speed and overwhelming force. A flanking hammer while the Death Guard re-engage from the front.

## The False Flag

Here's what makes The Borrowed dangerous beyond just being War Dogs: they show up looking like the good guys.

<!-- TODO: Close-up of the Imperial paint job — showing the "bad disguise" quality -->
<!-- TODO: Detail shot of where the disguise breaks down — wrong colors, sloppy iconography, chaos details bleeding through -->

The two War Dogs are painted to pass as Imperial Knights at a distance. Imperial colors, Imperial markings, the general shape of something that should be on your side. But look closer and it falls apart. The colors are wrong — not quite the right shade of anything official. The iconography is off, like someone described what an Imperial Knight looks like from memory and the pilot did their best. There are details that shouldn't be there if you know what to look for.

That's intentional — both in the lore and on the painting table. I didn't want them to look like actual Imperial Knights that secretly have chaos underneath. I wanted them to look like chaos War Dogs that did a bad job pretending. The disguise only needs to work for a few seconds — long enough to get within striking distance before the defenders realize those "reinforcements" on their flank are not friendly.

Painting them this way was a blast. Instead of trying to nail a perfect Imperial scheme, I was actively trying to get it *wrong* in the right ways. Slightly off colors, sloppy lines where a chaos pilot wouldn't care about precision, places where the original chaos heraldry is bleeding through the hasty paint job. It's a different kind of painting challenge — making something look deliberately bad without it actually looking bad on the table.

## On the Table

In the campaign, The Borrowed deployed on the opposite side of the board from the Death Guard main force. The Krieg were dug in facing the plague marines when two "Imperial Knights" appeared on their flank. By the time anyone realized what was happening, it was too late.

That's the gameplay fantasy — a pincer movement where the real threat isn't the rotting horde walking toward you. It's the "friendly" war machines that just turned their guns on your [artillery crew](/workshop/dioramas-and-storytelling/) — the 508th Krieg who never saw the betrayal coming.

The two War Dogs play as a fast, aggressive element alongside the grinding attrition of the Death Guard. The Death Guard tie you down. The Borrowed break you. Different armies, different roles, same side of the table.

## The Build

<!-- TODO: Any conversion work, weapon loadout details -->
<!-- TODO: Base detail shots showing terrain/basing work -->

Both War Dogs are built mostly stock. The real character comes from the paint job and the basing — tying them visually to the same campaign as the Death Guard and the 508th Krieg without making them look like they belong to either force. They're mercenaries. They're adjacent to the Death Guard aesthetic but clearly their own thing.

The bases are close to finished — just some final touch-ups to tie them into the same battlefield the rest of the campaign is being fought on.

## What's Next for The Borrowed

The campaign continues. The Borrowed did their job in Mission 2, but the question is whether the arrangement holds. Dreadblades are unreliable by nature — they serve themselves first and their clients second. As the war between the Death Guard and the 508th Siege Regiment escalates, The Borrowed might find better offers. Or they might decide the Death Guard owe them more than was agreed.

That's the beauty of narrative Crusade play. I don't know what happens next because I haven't played it yet. The story writes itself on the tabletop.

*The Borrowed are part of an ongoing Crusade campaign between my [Death Guard](/workshop/death-guard-paint-scheme/) and the 508th Siege Regiment. The first mission saw the Death Guard probe the Krieg trench line and fail — which is how The Borrowed got the call.*
