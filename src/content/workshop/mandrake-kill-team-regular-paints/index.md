I'm painting my [Mandrake](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Mandrake) Kill Team in [comic book style](/workshop/comic-book-minis/) — bold black lining, exaggerated highlights, the whole thing. But halfway through the squad, I'm switching paint types. The first five were done with regular paints. The next five are getting speed paints.

This post covers the first half. The recipe, the results, and what it's like doing comic book style on models that have zero hard edges.

<!-- TODO: Hero shot — all 5 Mandrakes together -->

## Why Mandrakes for Comic Book Style

Mandrakes are shadow-daemons. They're made of darkness and fire and stolen skin. Every surface on these models is organic — flowing flame tendrils, stretched leather, exposed muscle, hair that blends into shadow. There's not a flat armor panel on the entire kit.

That's the opposite of what comic book style is usually applied to. Space marines have clean geometric panels that are built for bold lining. Mandrakes have curves and flow and surfaces that melt into each other. The question going in was whether the black ink lining would fight the organic shapes or actually help define them.

Turns out — it helps. A lot. Mandrakes have so much surface detail that without strong definition, everything blurs together into a dark mass. The bold black lines carve out each element — flame from skin, skin from leather, leather from shadow — and suddenly you can read every part of the model even from across the table. The comic book style imposes structure on models that are designed to look chaotic, and the contrast is what makes them work.

## The Recipe

This is a straightforward scheme. The Mandrakes are mostly dark, which means the bright flame accents and the black ink lining do all the heavy lifting.

### Base Tones

| Area | Paint | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Skin | Deep grey | Applied as a solid base. Not black — you need the grey to be light enough that the black ink lines read against it. |
| Hair | White | Clean white, no shading. Keeps it stark and ghostly against the dark skin. |
| Leather patches | Sepia wash (multiple coats) | Built up over the base grey. The sepia gives the leather a worn, tanned look without needing a separate brown base coat. More coats = darker and richer. |

### Flames and Accents

Each Mandrake got a different bright color for their flames and highlighted details. The shadow-fire that writhes across their bodies is the focal point of every model, so giving each one a unique color makes the squad visually interesting instead of five identical dark shapes.

<!-- TODO: Individual Mandrake photos with flame colors noted -->
<!-- Mandrake 1: [color] flames — photo -->
<!-- Mandrake 2: [color] flames — photo -->
<!-- Mandrake 3: [color] flames — photo -->
<!-- Mandrake 4: [color] flames — photo -->
<!-- Mandrake 5: [color] flames — photo -->

The bright colors work because everything else on the model is muted. Dark grey skin, white hair, brown leather — it's a neutral palette that lets whatever flame color you pick absolutely sing. You could go neon green, hot pink, electric blue, whatever appeals to you. The dark base makes anything bright look like it's actually glowing.

### The Lining

| Step | Material | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| All edge lining | Black ink | Applied with a fine brush over everything else. Every transition between surfaces gets a line — flame to skin, skin to leather, leather to base, around every hair strand, along every muscle line. |

This is the step that takes the longest but makes the biggest difference. Black ink rather than black paint gives you a thinner, more consistent line with better flow. It self-levels into the grooves a bit, which is actually helpful on organic shapes where you're following curves rather than tracing straight edges.

On the space marines I've done in this style, the lining is fast because you're following geometric armor panel edges. On the Mandrakes, every line is a curve. You're tracing flame tendrils, muscle definition, the edges of stretched skin patches. It takes longer per model, but the payoff is worth it — the lining is what turns "dark model with bright spots" into "comic book Mandrake."

## What Worked

**The individual flame colors.** Having each Mandrake be a different color gives the squad visual variety without breaking the cohesion. The dark base, white hair, and black lining are the unifying thread — the flames are where each model gets personality.

**Black ink over black paint for the lining.** The flow characteristics of ink make a big difference on curved organic surfaces. Paint wants to blob and stick; ink wants to flow into the line. For comic book style on models like these, ink is the way to go.

**The simplicity of the base scheme.** Grey skin, white hair, sepia leather — three steps before you even touch the flames. Fast to lay down, consistent across models, and dark enough that it recedes behind the bright accents.

## What's Next — The Speed Paint Experiment

The next five Mandrakes are getting the same comic book treatment, but with speed paints instead of regular paints for the base tones. Same black ink lining at the end, same approach — just different paint for the foundation layers.

The question I want to answer: does speed paint work for comic book style? Speed paints are designed to do shading and highlighting in one coat through their self-leveling properties. But comic book style doesn't want subtle shading — it wants flat color with hard transitions defined by ink lines. Those two philosophies might work together or they might fight each other.

I genuinely don't know how it'll turn out. That's the point. When the second half is done, I'll put them side by side and give an honest comparison — time, finish quality, and which approach looks better on the table.
