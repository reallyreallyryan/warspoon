I wanted festive bases for a holiday painting project. Couldn't find exactly what I wanted online, so I opened up Blender and made my own. These are the first five designs — simple, printable, and free.

<!-- TODO: Group shot of all 5 bases here -->

## The Designs

Five 28mm bases, each with a different holiday scene sculpted into the top.

**Base 1 — Logs**
A couple of yule logs laid across the base. Simple and works as a subtle seasonal touch without going full Santa's workshop.

**Base 2 — Presents and Candy Cane**
Three wrapped presents with a candy cane lying across them. This one has the most going on and probably looks the best painted up with bright gift wrap colors.

**Base 3 — Four Presents**
A pile of four wrapped boxes, different sizes. Good if you want the gift theme without the candy cane.

**Base 4 — Logs, Present, and Sign**
A mix of elements — logs, a gift box, and a small sign. A little bit of everything on one base.

**Base 5 — Standing Candy Cane with Presents**
A candy cane standing upright with presents around the base. The vertical candy cane gives this one some height, which is a nice visual break when it's sitting next to the flatter designs.

## Print Settings

These were printed on a **Bambu A1 Mini** with a **0.2mm nozzle** on the textured PEI plate. The fine nozzle picks up the small details on the presents and candy cane ridges nicely.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Nozzle | 0.2mm |
| Layer height | 0.08mm |
| First layer height | 0.10mm |
| First layer temp | 225°C (stock is 220°C) |
| Z-offset (G-code) | G29.1 Z{0.06} for textured PEI plate |
| Max volumetric speed | 2 mm³/s |
| Everything else | Stock Bambu 0.2mm nozzle profile |

Only two changes from the default profile — first layer temperature bumped to 225°C and the Z-offset adjusted for the textured plate. That's it.

## Download

<!-- TODO: Add MakerWorld link -->
**[Download on MakerWorld](#)** — All 5 bases as individual STL files.

Set 2 is in the works with more designs including a melted snowman base. I'll link it here when it's ready.

*These were my first Blender-to-printer designs. If you print them, I'd love to see how they turn out — especially if you paint them in something other than traditional Christmas colors. Grimdark Christmas bases? Go for it.*
